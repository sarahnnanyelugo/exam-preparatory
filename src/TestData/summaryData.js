    question:
      "Which of the following gases contains the highest number of atoms at s.t.p?",

    examDetails:
      "Which of the following gases contains the highest number of atoms at s.p?",
    yourAnswer: "6 moles of neon",
    correctAnswer: "6 moles of neon",
    markObtained: 1,
    answerExplanation:
      "To determine the total number of atoms in each option, we’ll multiply the number of moles given by Avogadro’s number, which is 6.022×10236.022×1023 atoms/mole. However, for diatomic molecules like oxygen (O₂) and chlorine (Cl₂), and molecules like ethane (C₂H₆), we’ll need to consider the number of atoms in one molecule. ",
